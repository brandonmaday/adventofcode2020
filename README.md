# Advent of Code 2020

I've chosen to do Advent of Code 2020 in Golang because
* Golang is cool
* I don't write enough of it at work so I'm basically a novice
* AOC is great lesson fodder for learning new things!

## Structure
I've split each day into it's own folder with it's own README.md that explains that day's puzzles. AOC breaks up puzzles into 2 parts, giving a star for each one. The second almost always is an extension of the first, often sharing the same puzzle input. I've included my puzzle input for each so you should be able to clone and run this locally, batteries included.

## Coding Paradigm
Depending on the day and the problem I may use imperitive, functional, or object oriented programming.  I'll may go back and write the same problem in two differen't paradigms because I find that stuff fun (crazy am I).  If I do, I'll use _ip, _fp, and _oop in the file name's respectively.


## Disclaimer
I largely have ignored error handling and test cases. I chose to do that purposfully. I believe error handling and test cases are crucial to well written code that a user interacts with in some material way. Given this code will only ever have one input, that noone will use, I focused on honing my general Golang skills not on making production ready code.
